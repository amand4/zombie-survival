Zombie Survival

    Amid an apocalyptic world ZS is a survival system. It aims to share location and find more survivors and soon be able to share resources among them.

    This system is being developed by the last survivor who knows how to code.

## Key features developed
    - Register Survivors
    - Update Location
    - Search for survivors
    - View Watches
    - Survivor's Report

## Below, a brief explanation about the main features of the systems:
## FILL ALL FIELDS.

Register Survivors:
  Note: To register the survivors you must fill in all fields, such as: Name, Age, Sex and the items. Only location is not required. If not filled, will not be saved by the systems and other survivors will not    know of its existence, this also serves to update data.

## Map
    I already have an autocomplete, to make it easier to the user. When selecting the location where you are, click 'add' next to the field, otherwise your location will not be updated.

## Search
    You can search for survivors, just type in the search bar and click in 'find' if the survivor is registered, will be displayed, otherwise will not return anything

    The ZS system has some flaws! In addition to coding the system, I worked hard to build my barrier so that zombies would not invade my home. But I managed to implement a good part of the system, can soon share items.

   I hope that you enjoy it! (:

   Best regards,

   Michonne.
