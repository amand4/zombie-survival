Zombie Survival

    Amid an apocalyptic world, ZS is a survival system. It aims to share location and find more survivors and soon be able to share resources among them.

    This system is being developed by the last survivor who knows how to code.

## Key Features I developed
    - Register Survivors
    - Update Location
    - Search for survivors
    - View Watches
    - Report Infeted

## More about the features of the system:
## FILL ALL FIELDS.

Register Survivors:
  Note: To register the survivors you must fill in all fields, such as: Name, Age, Gender and the items. Only     location is not required. If not filled, will not be saved by the systems and other survivors will not      know of its existence, this also serves to update data.

## Map
    I already have an autocomplete, for ease. When selecting the location where you are click add next to the field, otherwise your location will not be updated.

## Search
    You can search for survivors, just type in the search bar and click 'find' if the survivor is registered, will be displayed, otherwise you will not return anything

    ZS system, I have some flaws besides coding the system, I have worked hard on building my barrier so that zombies do not invade my home. But I managed to be implementing a good part of the system, soon we will be able to share items

    I hope you enjoy and can use, pleasure Michonne
